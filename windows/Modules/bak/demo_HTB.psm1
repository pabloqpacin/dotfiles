# "Our module, when used, should output the host's computer name, IP address,
# and basic domain information, and provide us with the output of the C:\Users\
# directory so we can see what users have interactively logged into that host."

.Description  
This function performs some simple recon tasks for the user. We import the module and issue the 'Get-Recon' command to retrieve our output. Each variable and line within the function and script are commented for our understanding. Right now, this module will only work on the local host from which you run it, and the output will be sent to a file named 'recon.txt' on the Desktop of the user who opened the shell. Remote Recon functions are coming soon!  

.Example  
After importing the module run "Get-Recon"
'Get-Recon

.Notes  
Remote Recon functions coming soon! This script serves as our initial introduction to writing functions and scripts and making PowerShell modules.
