> how to pull a new branch 

To pull a new branch from a remote repository, you need to fetch the latest information from the remote and then check out the new branch. Here's a step-by-step guide to achieve this:

### 1. Fetch All Branches from the Remote

First, you need to fetch the latest information from the remote repository. This will update your local list of branches and their latest commits.

```bash
git fetch origin
```

### 2. Check Out the New Branch

After fetching the latest information, you can check out the new branch. This will create a local branch that tracks the remote branch.

```bash
git checkout -b <new-branch-name> origin/<new-branch-name>
```

Replace `<new-branch-name>` with the name of the branch you want to pull.

### Example

Suppose the new branch is called `feature-xyz`.

1. **Fetch the latest information from the remote**:
   ```bash
   git fetch origin
   ```

2. **Check out the new branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature-xyz origin/feature-xyz
   ```

### Summary

- **Fetch from remote**: `git fetch origin`
- **Check out the new branch**: `git checkout -b <new-branch-name> origin/<new-branch-name>`

This will create a new local branch that tracks the remote branch, allowing you to work with the latest changes from the remote repository.
