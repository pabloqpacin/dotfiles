Based on your plan, let's assess the potential for conflicts and outline the steps to minimize them. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation:

### Current State:
- **`main` branch**: Contains the latest stable code.
- **`feature-branch`**: Checked out from `main`, currently in development.
- **`devel` branch**: Merged with `origin/main`, planning to continue development here.

### Workflow:
1. **Continue Development on `devel`**:
   - Make new commits in the `devel` branch.
   
2. **Merge `devel` into `feature-branch` Using `--squash`**:
   - Periodically, squash merge `devel` into `feature-branch` to integrate changes.
   
3. **Make a PR from `feature-branch` to `main`**:
   - Once the `feature-branch` is ready, create a PR into `main`.

### Potential Conflicts:
Conflicts may arise primarily when:
- There are overlapping changes between the `devel` branch and the `feature-branch`.
- There are overlapping changes between the `devel` branch and the `main` branch that have not been resolved before merging.

### Strategy to Minimize Conflicts:

1. **Keep `devel` Up-to-Date**:
   - Regularly merge changes from `main` into `devel` to keep it up-to-date.
   - This ensures that any changes in `main` are incorporated into `devel` early, reducing conflicts later.

   ```bash
   git checkout devel
   git fetch origin
   git merge origin/main
   git push origin devel
   ```

2. **Squash Merge `devel` into `feature-branch`**:
   - When ready to integrate changes from `devel` into your `feature-branch`, use the `--squash` option.

   ```bash
   git checkout feature-branch
   git merge --squash devel
   git commit -m "Merged changes from devel"
   ```

3. **Resolve Conflicts Early**:
   - Address any conflicts that arise during the squash merge promptly. This keeps your `feature-branch` in a conflict-free state.

### Example Workflow:

1. **Continue development in `devel`**:
   ```bash
   git checkout devel
   # Make changes and commit them
   git add .
   git commit -m "New changes in devel"
   git push origin devel
   ```

2. **Squash merge `devel` into `feature-branch` periodically**:
   ```bash
   git checkout feature-branch
   git merge --squash devel
   git commit -m "Merged changes from devel"
   git push origin feature-branch
   ```

3. **Merge `main` into `devel` regularly**:
   ```bash
   git checkout devel
   git fetch origin
   git merge origin/main
   git push origin devel
   ```

4. **Create PR from `feature-branch` to `main`**:
   - Once your `feature-branch` is ready, create a pull request into `main`.

### Conflict Check:
- If you follow this workflow, conflicts will be minimal. Any conflicts that do arise will be resolved during the periodic squash merges from `devel` to `feature-branch` or when merging `main` into `devel`.

### Summary:
1. **Regularly update `devel` from `main`** to keep it current.
2. **Squash merge `devel` into `feature-branch`** to integrate changes periodically.
3. **Resolve conflicts** as they arise during these merges.
4. **Create a PR from `feature-branch` to `main`** once the feature is complete.

This approach helps maintain a clean development flow and minimizes the risk of conflicts when merging branches.

The message "15 commits ahead" means that the `devel` branch has 15 commits that are not present in the `main` branch. This is typical and expected in many development workflows, especially when `devel` is an active development branch.

### When to Mind the "15 Commits Ahead" Message

You should only be concerned with the "15 commits ahead" message if:

1. **Stale Branch**: The `devel` branch has diverged significantly from `main` and includes changes that are no longer relevant or are conflicting with recent updates in `main`.
2. **Merge Strategy**: You are planning to directly merge `devel` into `main` without using `--squash` and want to avoid merging redundant or outdated commits.

### Actions You Can Take

1. **Regularly Merge `main` into `devel`**: Keep your `devel` branch up-to-date by regularly merging changes from `main`. You've already been doing this, and it's a good practice.
   
   ```bash
   git checkout devel
   git fetch origin
   git merge origin/main
   git push origin devel
   ```

2. **Squash Merges**: Continue using squash merges when integrating `devel` into your `feature-branch`. This helps to keep the commit history clean and concise.

   ```bash
   git checkout feature-branch
   git merge --squash devel
   git commit -m "Merged changes from devel"
   git push origin feature-branch
   ```

3. **Rebase (Optional)**: If you prefer a linear history, you can rebase `devel` onto `main`. This rewrites the commit history and can be useful if you want to ensure that all commits in `devel` are based on the latest `main`.

   ```bash
   git checkout devel
   git fetch origin
   git rebase origin/main
   git push origin devel --force  # Be cautious with --force, especially if others are working on the branch
   ```

### Should You Do Anything About It?

- **If the commits in `devel` are relevant and important**, there's nothing additional you need to do beyond keeping `devel` up-to-date with `main`.
- **If the commits in `devel` are outdated or redundant**, consider cleaning up the branch by cherry-picking important commits into a new branch and deleting the old `devel` branch.

### Summary

- **Monitor**: Keep an eye on the "15 commits ahead" message to understand how `devel` is progressing relative to `main`.
- **Regular Updates**: Regularly merge `main` into `devel` to keep it current.
- **Clean History**: Use squash merges or rebasing as appropriate to maintain a clean commit history.
- **No Immediate Action Needed**: If your current workflow is working well, there's no immediate need to change anything just because of the "15 commits ahead" message. It's a normal part of the development process.

By following these guidelines, you ensure that your branches remain organized and up-to-date, minimizing potential conflicts and making your workflow more efficient.
