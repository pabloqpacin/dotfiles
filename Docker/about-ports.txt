I see, I misunderstood your question. I apologize for the confusion.

Yes, you can change the port on the container side as well. The important thing is to understand the application inside the container and ensure that you're mapping the correct ports.

In your example:

```bash
sudo docker run --detach \
    --name mariadb-container \
    --env MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=my-secret-pw \
    --publish 3307:3306 \
    --volume mariadb_data:/var/lib/mysql \
    mariadb:latest
```

Here, `--publish 3307:3306` is mapping port 3307 on the host to port 3306 on the container. The port on the container side is 3306, which is the default port for MariaDB/MySQL. If you want to change the port on the container side, you would modify the part after the colon (`:`) in the `-p` option:

```bash
sudo docker run --detach \
    --name mariadb-container \
    --env MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=my-secret-pw \
    --publish 3307:3308 \  # Change the container port to 3308
    --volume mariadb_data:/var/lib/mysql \
    mariadb:latest
```

Now, you are mapping port 3307 on the host to port 3308 on the container.

** It's worth noting that if you change the container port, you need to ensure that the application inside the container is configured to use that specific port. If it's a database like MariaDB or MySQL, make sure the database server inside the container is configured to listen on the new port. **
