If you have committed changes in the detached state and you want to bring them over to the main branch, you can create a new branch from the current commit, switch to the main branch, and merge the changes:

bash
Copy code
# Create a new branch from the current commit
git branch new-branch-name

# Switch to the main branch
git switch main

# Merge changes from the new branch
git merge new-branch-name
After these steps, you will have your changes merged into the main branch.
