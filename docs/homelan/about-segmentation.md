Setting static IPs for devices in your home network can be beneficial, especially for devices that you want to access consistently. This is particularly useful for services like printers, servers, or network-attached storage (NAS) devices. On the other hand, for most devices in a typical home network, DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) is often sufficient and more convenient.

Here's a general guideline on when to consider static IPs:

1. **Static IPs:**
   - **Servers:** Devices providing services like web servers, media servers, etc.
   - **Network Infrastructure:** Routers, switches, access points.

2. **DHCP:**
   - **End-user Devices:** Laptops, tablets, smartphones, etc.
   - **Printers, Smart TVs:** If your router's DHCP assigns consistent IPs.

For setting up a VLAN in your home network:

1. **Router Capabilities:**
   - Check if your router supports VLANs. Not all consumer-grade routers support VLAN configuration. If your router doesn't support VLANs, you might need to consider using custom firmware like DD-WRT or consider upgrading to a router with more advanced features.

2. **Managed Switch:**
   - Since you have a nice switch, check if it supports VLANs. Managed switches provide the necessary features for VLAN configuration. If your switch supports VLANs, you're in a good position to proceed.

3. **Configuration Steps:**
   - Configure VLANs on the managed switch. Define VLANs, assign ports to VLANs, etc.
   - Set up the VLANs on your router if it supports VLAN tagging.
   - Ensure devices connected to different VLANs can communicate as needed.

4. **Subnets:**
   - If you're creating a separate VLAN (e.g., 192.168.100.0/24), consider configuring different subnets for each VLAN. Ensure routing is set up appropriately on your router.

5. **Security:**
   - VLANs can enhance security by segmenting the network. For example, you might have a separate VLAN for IoT devices.

6. **Testing:**
   - Test thoroughly to ensure that devices within the same VLAN can communicate and devices on different VLANs are appropriately isolated.

Remember to take necessary precautions, backup configurations, and be aware that misconfiguring network settings could lead to temporary loss of connectivity. If you're not comfortable with advanced networking configurations, consider seeking assistance or learning gradually to avoid disruptions.
